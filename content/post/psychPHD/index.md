*Disclaimer: I am but one person, and this is my attempt to write out a generic outline of what one should do before applying to PhD programs in psychology. This should be taken with a grain of salt and following this guide is not a guarantee of admission to any program.*

It occurred to me that there are many disjointed guides for applying to graduate school, and many of these guides do not provide a concrete timeline of events. What I wanted to do here was to provide a \"calendar\" for when and how to apply to non-clinical psych PhD programs. 

Creating a strong application to PhD programs takes a lot of time and effort on the applicant's part. I strongly encourage reading [this](https://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/psn/2014/01/applying-graduate) before you begin. For those hoping to do clinical psychology, I will refer you to [Mitch Prinstein](http://mitch.web.unc.edu/files/2017/02/MitchGradSchoolAdvice.pdf), who could provide more information than I ever could.


Let's start with the materials. There are a few things most programs will want. I have ordered them in terms of how early I think you should start thinking about them.

1. Exams (GREs, TOEFL)
2. CV
3. Personal Statement
4. Letters of Recommendation
5. Transcripts

===

You should aim to do any applicable exam as early as possible when you have time. They are not something you want to be doing when you're busy with other things. Keep in mind that TOEFL scores expire after two years, and GREs are falling out of fashion (for good reason).

### The year before you want to start grad school: 
#### January 
This may seem early, but for a procrastinator like myself, I recommend giving yourself at least 10 months before deadlines. Start by creating and compiling a CV. For me, this was the easiest way to feel productive without having to exert as much effort compared to the other things on the todo list. I think [this](https://psychology.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/APPLYING%20TO%20GRADUATE%20SCHOOL%20IN%20PSYCHOLOGY.PDF) provides descriptions for what needs to go into the CV. My approach to this was to create a laundry list of things I had done in different positions after starting college. 

#### February
Now that you've taken stock of your life, consider what you want to start googling programs. 

#### March
Start on the personal statement. This is a continual work in progress until the deadline. It's okay to feel sick of reading your own words, but this is also why you need to start this early. Keep in mind you will need to tailor parts of these to the individual programs.


#### June
You should start thinking about whom you want to write your letters of recommendation. Think about which faculty could speak the most to your abilities and experiences; this means professors with whom you've had the most contact. Be prepared to provide them with a list of points you would like them to cover in the letter (e.g., reminders about projects you worked on, what you did in collaboration with them, etc.)

#### September:
This is roughly when 

Let's work from the end--the submission. Most deadlines are in November or December.

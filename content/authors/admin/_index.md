I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/psychology/) at Royal Holloway, University of London.

Social groups and tribes provide immense benefits (e.g., social belonging) but incur great costs (e.g., intergroup conflict). Thus, understanding how social group memberships affect our actions and perception of the world may help us to best harness these two byproducts of social groups. Broadly speaking, I am interested in (i) how social group information affects our judgments and choice behavior towards others and (ii) how we understand who is and is not a member of our social groups in the first place (which can in turn affect our behavior towards others).
